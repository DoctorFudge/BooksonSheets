This is a heap of spaghetti code that I was slapping together mostly as an excuse to learn javascript and HTML. It is a giant mess and I should probably start from scratch, but it works for me and I'm pretty much finished with it. So I have decided to release it.

You should just make a copy of this Google Sheet document. If you wish to start from scratch anyway, take careful note of all of the functions in many of the cells, and be aware that these scripts and such won't work very well without them:

For a demonstration of how this sheet can look, you can take a look at my personal collection and make fun of both my poor tastes, and my bizarre obsession with details (This is a copy I made just to avoid linking my current setup):

There is a webapp deployment ready to go in the template sheet (see How to Use This Sheet). Again, for a full demo, you can check out the following:
